# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction System

## 📌 Project Description
The **Loan Approval Prediction System** is a Machine Learning–based project that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, and employment status.  
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data science workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, evaluation, and prediction.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Financial institutions receive thousands of loan applications daily. Manually evaluating each application is time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent.  
There is a need for an automated system that can **accurately and efficiently predict loan approval** using historical data.
