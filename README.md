🚀 Project Title

Loan Approval Prediction System (change if different project)

📌 Overview

This project is a Machine Learning–based system that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant information. It demonstrates a complete end-to-end ML workflow including data preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

🎯 Problem Statement

Manual loan approval processes are time-consuming and may lead to inconsistent decisions.
This project aims to build an intelligent prediction system that helps financial institutions make fast, data-driven, and accurate loan approval decisions.

✅ Objectives

Clean and preprocess real-world data

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Build multiple ML models

Compare models and select the best one

Evaluate performance using standard metrics
